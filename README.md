# **Description**
Welcome aboard, fellow developer. This is where you can find interesting methods (used *Laboratory 1* from the best senior lecturer) using recursion and functions which you are free to use
## **Recursion and Functions in Java**
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
## Recursive Functions
The following are examples of recursive functions included in this repository:

__factorial(n)__ - computes the factorial of a given integer using recursion.

__fibonacci(n)__ - computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.


__findMin()__-finding minimum of array
__findAvg()__-finding average of array

__isPrime()__-function that checks the number for prime or composite

__factorial()__-function that solve the problem like n!(factorial)

__fibanacci()__-finding the fibanacci number of xertain index

__sumFibanacci()__-determine of sum fibanacci number until certain index

__degree(int a ,int b)__- function that solve a^b

__isDigit()__-checks stroke for numeric or not numeric situation

__euclideanAlgorithm()__-function that find the GCD of 2 integers

__reverse(int[] arr,int start, int end)__-the function that making array reversive without using array data structure.
